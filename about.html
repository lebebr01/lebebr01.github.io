<hr />

<p><img src="images/twitProfileSmall.jpg" alt="floatright" />
I am about to transistion to a tenure track position in the <a href="http://www.education.uiowa.edu/pq/measstat">Educational Measurement and Statistics</a> program at the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>.  This position is a bit unique as I will be working half time with the <a href="https://itp.education.uiowa.edu/">Iowa Testing Program</a> and also half time as a faculty member.  I am excited to embark on this new adventure and move back closer to family and friends.</p>

<p>I am wrapping up my position as Visiting Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://edfd.uark.edu/">Educational Statistics and Research Methods</a> program at the <a href="http://uark.edu">University of Arkansas</a> in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  Prior to this, I worked for a year at <a href="http://www.spps.org">Saint Paul Public Schools</a> as an Assessment Specialist in the Research, Evaluation, and Assessment department.</p>

<p>I recently graduated from the <a href="http://www.cehd.umn.edu/EdPsych/programs/QME/">Quantitative Methods in Education</a> program at the University of Minnesota in February 2013.  While there I specialized in applied statistics and became interested in longitudinal modeling and computational methods.  I also enjoy computing in general and have become proficient in numerous statistical programming languages, especially <em>R</em>.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Assumption Violations with the Linear Mixed Model:</strong>  Model assumptions are needed for estimation, however real world data is messy.  My research attempts to explore situations when data violates certain assumptions and the implications this has on estimation and ultimately on the inferences we draw.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Promoting STEM Majors:</strong>  The USA is falling behind other nations in the number of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics majors produced every year.  I am interested in identifying students who may be interested in a STEM major early and fostering early development/interest in STEM related topics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>College Football:</strong>  Archival college football data has been pulled from various locations.  In collaboration with Andrew Zieffler, we are attempting to profile successful coaches to predict the next great coach.  In addition, we hope to predict teams that will make a bowl game next season.</p></li>
</ul>
